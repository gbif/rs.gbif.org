  "description": "Treatments are parts of publications that \"treat\" a single taxon. They can be an original description for a new species, but also subsequent taxonomic works and usually include several sections such as a diagnosis, description, material examined, distribution, etc. ColDP captures an entire treatment either as an TXT, HTML or XML document that lives as an individual file in a subfolder treatments and is named by the corresponding taxonID of the name usage it describes. The taxons accordingToID should always point to the reference the treatment is published in. Example: treatments/19854332.html would be an html document which is the marked up treatment for the taxon with ID 19854332.",
