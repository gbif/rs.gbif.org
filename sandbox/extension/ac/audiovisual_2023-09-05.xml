        dc:description="The Audiovisual Core is a set of vocabularies designed to represent metadata for biodiversity multimedia resources and collections. These vocabularies aim to represent information that will help to determine whether a particular resource or collection will be fit for some particular biodiversity science application before acquiring the media. Among others, the vocabularies address such concerns as the management of the media and collections, descriptions of their content, their taxonomic, geographic, and temporal coverage, and the appropriate ways to retrieve, attribute and reproduce them.">

The title facilitates interactions with humans: e.g., it could be used as display text of hyperlinks or to provide a choice of images in a pick list. The title is therefore highly useful and an effort should be made to provide it where it is not already available. When the resource is a collection without an institutional or official name, but with a thematic content, a descriptive title, e. g. &quot;Urban Ants of New England,&quot; would be suitable. In individual media resources depicting taxa, the scientific name or names of taxa often form a good title. Common names in addition to or instead of scientific names are also acceptable. Indications of action or roles captured by the media resource, such as predatory acts, are desirable (&quot;Rattlesnake eating deer mouse&quot;, &quot;Pollinators of California Native Plants&quot;)."/>

If possible, add this information here even if the title or caption of the resource already contains scientific taxon names. Where the list of scientific taxon names is impractically large (e.g., media collections or identification tools), the number of taxa should be given in Taxon Count (see below). If possible, avoid repeating the Taxonomic Coverage here. Do not use abbreviated Genus names (&quot;P. vulgaris&quot;). It is recommended to provide author citation to scientific names, to avoid ambiguities in the presence of homonyms (the same name created by different authors for different taxa). Identifier qualifications should be supplied in the Identification Qualifier term rather than here (i. e. &quot;Abies cf. alba&quot; is deprecated, to be replaced with Scientific Taxon Name = &quot;Abies alba&quot; and Identification Qualifier = &quot;cf. species&quot;)."/>

Where the exchange format only supports simple multiplicities, a media item with multiple Scientific Taxon Names, some with, some without identification qualifiers, may have to be transferred with &quot;cf.&quot; or &quot;aff.&quot; qualifiers remaining embedded in the Scientific Taxon Name. Example: For the determinations &quot;cf. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. palmarum&quot;, &quot;Fusarium cf. oxysporum f. sp. palmarum&quot;, &quot;Fusarium oxysporum cf. f. sp. palmarum&quot; the Scientific Taxon Name would always be &quot;Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. palmarum&quot;, with Identification Qualifier &quot;cf. genus&quot;, &quot;cf. species&quot; and &quot;cf. f.sp.&quot;, respectively.
