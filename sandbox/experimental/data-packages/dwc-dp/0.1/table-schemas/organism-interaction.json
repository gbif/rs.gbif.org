  "description": "An interaction between two dwc:Organisms during a dwc:Event.",
  "comments": "Supports only primary observed interactions, not habitual or derived taxon-level interactions. Pairwise interactions must be used to represent multi-organism interactions. When possible, typify the action rather than the state from which an action is inferred, with the actor as the subject dwc:Occurrence and the acted-upon as the related dwc:Occurrence. Only one direction of a two-way interaction is necessary, though both are permissible as distinct OrganismInteractions with distint subject dwc:Occurrences.",
  "examples": "`a bee visiting a flower`; `a Mallophora ruficauda hunting an Apis mellifera in flight`; `a viral infection in a plant`; `a female spider mating with a male spider`; `a lion cub nursing from its mother`; `a mosquito sucking blood from a chimpanzee's arm`; `a slug eating a fungus growing on decomposing stump (2 interactions)`",
